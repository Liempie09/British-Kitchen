                        <h3>Fish and Chips</h3>
                        <div class="dish-info">
                            <p>The quintessential British fast food consisting of battered and deep-fried fish (typically cod or haddock) served with thick-cut fried potatoes.</p>
                            <div class="dish-facts">
                                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Contrary to popular belief, fish and chips has roots in both Jewish and French cooking traditions, dating back to the 1860s.</p>
                                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> During World War II, fish and chips was one of the few foods not subject to rationing, as the government recognized its importance to national morale.</p>

                            <div class="read-more-content" id="fish-chips-more">
                                <p>The dish originated when Jewish immigrants from Portugal and Spain brought their tradition of frying fish in a thin batter to England in the 15th century. The "chips" part came later, with fried potatoes becoming popular in the 19th century.</p>
                                <p>By 1910, there were over 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and the dish played an important role in feeding factory workers during the Industrial Revolution. Today, it remains a beloved comfort food throughout Britain, often served with salt, vinegar, and sometimes mushy peas.</p>

                        <div class="dish-info">
                            <p>A hearty morning meal featuring bacon, sausages, eggs, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, black pudding, and toast.</p>
                            <div class="dish-facts">
                                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> The full English breakfast became popular during the Victorian era, though many of its components have much longer histories.</p>
                                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Also known as a "fry-up," this meal was traditionally designed to prepare people for a long day of physical labor.</p>

                            <div class="read-more-content" id="english-more">
                                <p>The full English breakfast reached its peak of popularity in Edwardian Britain, and despite a decline following the food shortages of World War II, it remains a beloved weekend tradition and is often served all day in cafes and pubs.</p>
                                <p>Regional variations exist throughout the UK, with the "Full Scottish" often including potato scones, the "Full Welsh" sometimes featuring laverbread (seaweed), and the "Ulster Fry" in Northern Ireland typically including soda bread and potato bread.</p>

                        <h3>Shepherd's Pie</h3>
                        <div class="dish-info">
                            <p>A comforting casserole made with minced lamb, vegetables, and gravy, topped with a layer of mashed potatoes and baked until golden.</p>
                            <div class="dish-facts">
                                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Developed in the late 18th century as a way for frugal housewives to repurpose leftover roasted meat.</p>
                                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> When made with beef instead of lamb, the dish is properly called "Cottage Pie" - Shepherd's Pie specifically refers to the lamb version (as shepherds tend sheep).</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="read-more-content" id="shepherds-more">
                                <p>The dish emerged during a time when potatoes were becoming a staple food for the poor in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The potato topping provided an affordable way to stretch small amounts of meat into a filling family meal.</p>
                                <p>Traditional recipes include onions, carrots, and peas in the meat mixture, though modern variations might include a wider range of vegetables or different seasonings. The dish exemplifies British comfort food at its finest - hearty, warming, and satisfying.</p>
